# Learning-to-Win-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-DRL-in-Board-Games
A comprehensive implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents trained to play Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four through self-play. This project demonstrates how neural networks can learn strategic gameplay from scratch without human-designed features or labeled training data.
